# Design Studio Feedback

**Partner team**: David Brown, Fil Piasevoli, and Aaron Zampaglione

We used the design mockup that we submitted as part of our proposal as a starting point for our project discussion. Not only was our pater group's feedback fair and insightful, but they helped us settle some questions about our design that were uncertain until we heard their feedback.

Regarding our overall design, the other team expressed some confusion about how interaction would work among page elements. When we produced our mockup, we imagined an intuitive order of interaction, where the earliest elements on the page dynamically alter and restrict/enable functionality of elements below. For example, the selection of a Boston sports team would restrict the types of special filters that would be available to the user further down the page. The design shows a "Yankees" button (that would display MBTA traffic for Red Sox-Yankees games) that would be clearly useless when viewing data about the Celtics; we learned from their observation that we must make it clear that some selections will alter the availability of others.

The other group also raised a question that we had not fully considered: would users be allowed to select data for more than one team at a time? We had imagined that data from only one team at a time would be displayed, but seriously considered otherwise in response to their questioning. Though this was an interesting idea, we ultimately all concluded that such an interaction paradigm would be unworkable. It would be difficult to present overlapping and/or mutually exclusive seasons, and station-specific charts would not work well when displaying more than one station with significantly different traffic patterns.

Finally, we had considered including a geographic visualization of station traffic across the entire MBTA subway system. We might have also made the visualization interactive, allowing users to select one station or several. The other team pointed out that the information conveyed by such a visualization would only be useful in a limited set of contexts, and that we were already presenting the most useful data in the charts that we had designed so far.

We will address our partner group's feedback in future revisions by leaving out design elements that they suggested excluding (geographic visualizations), ensuring that we appropriately illustrate interaction "hierarchy" among page elements, and maintaining our plan to only allow a single team selection.
